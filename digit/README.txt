Dig-It! Games coding assessment solution / Don Peterkofsky
==========================================================

This solution addresses the following requirements:

1. Create a web app that drills addition equations.  This is 
implemented in the "Game" state of the application.

2. The app should appear as a native application on iOS when 
it is installed on the device home screen.  This is addressed 
by adding the special Apple meta-tag to the index.html, as 
discussed with Steve.

3. It should also run in a browser.  Yes, it does.

4. The app should display three screens: a main menu, an equation 
screen, and an end of game screen.  This is addressed by the three 
application states: Home, Game, Results.

Caveats -

Due to time constraints, the following requirements were not implemented:

1. "In this manner, display five addition equations, alternating 
between displaying the equation vertically and horizontally."  The 
solution does not do the alternating between two layouts; all 
equations are displayed horizontally.

2. "The end of game screen should display a list of all of the equations 
presented to the player, along with the playerâ€™s solution and an indication 
of whether the solution was correct or not."  The individual equations and 
solutions are not displayed; only an indication of correct/incorrect for 
each equation is displayed.

Also, the layout in the various application states is not ideal, as a function 
of the HTML5 game framework I used.  And, there is a small bug when returning
to a new game via "Play Again", which I haven't yet resolved.

Bonus -> Dragging/dropping the digits plays a sound, and an appropriate sound is 
played for correct and incorrect answers when all digits have been placed.
